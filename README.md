# Brief Explanation:
Built a recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

# Detailed Explanation:
In this project, I created a recommendation system to suggest movies to users by leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

# Methodology:

Data Collection: Used datasets containing user ratings, movie metadata, and viewing history.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to find similar users or movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Used movie metadata to recommend similar movies based on genres, actors, and directors.
Hybrid Approach: Combined both collaborative and content-based methods for improved recommendations.
Evaluation: Assessed recommendation quality using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and precision-recall at k.
# Impact:
This model can enhance user engagement on streaming platforms by providing personalized recommendations, thereby increasing user satisfaction and retention.
